You have n coins and you want to build a staircase with these coins. The staircase consists of k rows where the ith row has exactly i coins. The last row of the staircase may be incomplete.
Given the integer n, return the number of complete rows of the staircase you will build
Input: n = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2


class Solution:
    def arrangeCoins(self, n: int) -> int:
        l=1
        r=n
        res=0
        while l<=r:
            mid=(l+r)//2
            coins=mid*(mid+1)/2   #sum of fist n coins formula
            if coins>n:
                r=mid-1
            else:
                l=mid+1
                res=max(mid,res)
        return res
